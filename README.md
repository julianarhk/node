# **Node.js Tutorial**

Welcome to the Node.js Tutorial! In this tutorial, you will explore the basics of Node.js and its functionalities.

## **What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, which means that you can use JavaScript for backend development as well as frontend development.

Node.js is a popular choice for building web applications and web servers because of its event-driven and non-blocking I/O model. This means that it can handle multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the event loop, making it an efficient and scalable platform for building web applications and other types of software.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with Node.js, you will need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/.

Once you have installed Node.js, you can create a new Node.js project by creating a new directory and running `npm init`. This will create a `package.json` file that will allow you to manage your project dependencies.

## **Basic Functionalities**

In this tutorial, you will explore some of the basic functionalities of Node.js, including:

* Creating a web server
* Reading and writing files
* Handling HTTP requests and responses
* Using modules

Each topic will include code examples and explanations to help you understand how to use these functionalities in your own projects.

## **Conclusion**

Node.js is a powerful platform for building web applications and other types of software. In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of Node.js and its functionalities, which will give you a solid foundation for further exploration.

So, let's dive in and start exploring Node.js!
